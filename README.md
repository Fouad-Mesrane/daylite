# **daylite**  App

## Introduction

**daylite** is a lightweight social media platform designed around the principle that less is more. In an age of constant digital noise, **daylite** encourages users to focus on quality over quantity by allowing only one post per day. This simple limitation fosters a more intentional and meaningful sharing experience.

### Key Features

- One Post Per Day: Users can create and share only one post per day, making each post more thoughtful and valuable.
- Gamified Leaderboard: Posts gain visibility through engagement, with a public leaderboard showcasing the most liked content.
- Encourages Real-Life Experiences: By limiting social media time, Daylite motivates users to step away from their screens, explore the world, and return with meaningful moments to share.
- Quality Over Quantity: Instead of endless scrolling, Daylite inspires users to focus on producing high-quality content that truly resonates.

### Why **daylite** ?

Whether you're a creator looking to showcase your best content or someone who wants to break free from mindless scrolling, **daylite**  helps you engage with social media in a healthier, more fulfilling way.

### How It Works
Post Once a Day: Capture your best moment of the day and share it with your followers.
